### Suicide Prevention App for users in Pakistan

>In Pakistan, suicide rates have increased, due to numerous factors- including style of living, societal pressure, illiteracy,
lack of therapy, treatments and individual attention. With the increasing accessibility of smartphones, to all classes of the
Pakistani society- we believe it is essential for their to be an application that compensates for the attention that is lacking towards
individuals in the Pakistani society that cannot express themselves and their feelings in fear of being judged, punished or simply
not taken seriously. This app aims to link the user to helplines, websites, emergency contacts, information, advice pages etc. in order to minimize the possibilities of one being pushed to the point of death.
